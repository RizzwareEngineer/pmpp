# About
Write PMPP kernels without worrying about host code for faster learning. 

Instead of simply providing the solutions to the book's exercises, 
I thought it'd be nice to enable new readers with a "skeleton" to simply focus on 
writing their kernels and then see the results ASAP without worrying about host code.

# Manual
Simply `cd` into the chapter you're reading: 
```
```

Implement the kernel you're learning about - you could peak at the corresponding host code if you desire: 
```
```

Then run `python main.py` to see the results:
```
```

# Notes
In light of PMPP's upcoming newest edition, I thought about this making this simple tool to help new readers.
I'm thinking that a Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab version of this skeleton may be worth looking into. 
We'll see. This shouldn't...take too long to setup.
